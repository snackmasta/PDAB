- Efficient data storage using collections.deque
- Professional industrial color scheme
- Integrated seamlessly with existing HMI

### 6. HMI Production Display Updates ✅

**Updated `hmi.py`:**
- **Real Production Values**: Replaced placeholder values with live data
- **Dynamic Color Coding**: Production metrics change color based on performance
  - Green: Good performance (>80% efficiency, >4 L/min production)
  - Orange: Moderate performance (60-80% efficiency, 2-4 L/min production)
  - Red: Poor performance (<60% efficiency, <2 L/min production)

### 3. Functional System Alarms ✅

**Implemented Real Alarm System:**
- **Emergency Stop**: Red indicator when emergency is active
- **Low Tank Level**: Orange when ground tank < minimum
- **RO Pressure Fault**: Orange when pressure outside optimal range
- **System Leak**: Red when ALM101 is triggered
- **High Tank Level**: Orange when roof tank > maximum
- **Pump Fault**: Orange when critical pumps fail during operation
- **Water Quality**: Orange when turbidity exceeds maximum
- **General Alarm**: Red when system alarm is active

**Alarm Features:**
- Color-coded checkboxes (Red: Critical, Orange: Warning)
- Active alarm summary with count
- Real-time status updates

### 4. Enhanced SCADA-Style Interface ✅

**Professional Layout:**
- System control bar with status and buttons
- Production metrics overview section
- Grouped components (pumps, tanks with progress bars)
- Real-time alarm panel
- Process data section
- Trends placeholder for future expansion

### 5. Technical Implementation Details

**Production Rate Calculation Logic:**
```python
# Base rates adjusted by efficiency factors
current_rate = RO_RATE * efficiency_factor
# Apply degradation for poor conditions
if turbidity > 3.0: rate *= 0.85
if pressure_out_of_range: rate *= 0.9
```

**Efficiency Calculation:**
```python
# Based on average production vs theoretical maximum
avg_production = total_produced / (uptime * 0.5)
base_efficiency = (avg_production / max_theoretical_rate) * 100
# Apply penalties for alarms, pump failures
```

**Alarm Logic:**
- Real-time monitoring of system parameters
- Threshold-based triggering
- Visual and textual feedback
- Categorized by severity (Critical/Warning)

## Testing Instructions

1. **Run Enhanced HMI**: `python test_enhanced_hmi.py`
2. **Test Production Metrics**: 
   - Start system and observe production rate updates
   - Watch efficiency calculations
   - Monitor total produced accumulation
3. **Test Alarm System**:
   - Trigger emergency stop
   - Let tanks reach limit levels
   - Observe pressure fluctuations
4. **Verify Color Coding**:
   - Good operation: Green values
   - Poor conditions: Orange/Red values

## Files Modified

1. **`process.py`**: Added production tracking and calculation methods
2. **`hmi.py`**: Updated GUI for real metrics and functional alarms
3. **`test_enhanced_hmi.py`**: Test script with demonstration features

## Performance Characteristics
