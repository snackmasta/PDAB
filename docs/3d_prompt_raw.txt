Generate an extremely detailed 3D model of a modular desalination and rooftop storage system, with a strong focus on the physical and functional connections between each process section. The model must include: seawater intake structure, pre-treatment filtration unit, reverse osmosis (RO) desalination unit, post-treatment unit with mineralization and UV disinfection, ground storage tank, pump room, rooftop storage tank, and building distribution. Clearly show all process piping and flow paths for water and brine, including every connection from intake through filtration, RO, post-treatment, storage, transfer, and waste discharge. For each connection, indicate the direction of flow, the type and size of pipe, and the physical interface (flange, valve, sensor tap, etc). Physically represent all key equipment: intake pump (P-101), RO high-pressure pump (P-102), post-treatment pump (P-103), transfer pumps (P-104 to P-106), all motorized valves (V-101 to V-106), UV disinfection unit (UV-101), general alarm (ALM-101), and pressure relief valve (PRV-101). Show all sensors in their real-world locations and how they are connected to the process: level transmitters (LT-101, LT-102) on tanks, flow transmitters (FT-101, FT-102) in piping, pressure transmitters (PT-101, PT-102) on RO unit, and turbidity sensor (TU-101) after pre-treatment. Include the PLC or control panel, with explicit cable routing or network connections to every sensor and actuator, and show local/remote/manual/auto switches where present. The 3D layout must visually separate each process section, but also make clear how water, brine, and signals move between them. Use realistic proportions and industrial conventions for tanks, pumps, piping, and equipment. Visually distinguish process water, brine, and waste streams, and show all safety features such as emergency stop, pressure relief, overflow protection, and alarm indicators in their actual locations. All process, control, and safety elements must be labeled, and the model should be suitable for engineering review, showing every connection and interface between process, control, and safety systems, as well as the logical and physical flow from one plan section to the next.
