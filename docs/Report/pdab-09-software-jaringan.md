# Perangkat Lunak Jaringan Kendali

Perangkat lunak jaringan kendali terdiri dari:
- **PLC Program**: Logika kontrol utama (Structured Text/ladder) untuk mengatur urutan operasi, safety, dan fault handling.
- **HMI/SCADA**: Antarmuka operator berbasis software (misal: Python Tkinter, WinCC, Wonderware) untuk monitoring status, alarm, dan kontrol manual.
- **Komunikasi**: Protokol komunikasi industri (Modbus, Ethernet/IP) untuk pertukaran data antara PLC, HMI, dan perangkat lain.
- **Simulasi**: Program simulasi (misal: Python) untuk pengujian logika dan visualisasi proses sebelum implementasi fisik.
- **Data Logging**: Fitur pencatatan data proses untuk analisis dan troubleshooting.

## Lampiran: Control System Plan and I/O Table

### 1. Control Philosophy
- The system is fully automated with manual override for all pumps and valves.
- Main control logic is based on water levels, flow, pressure, and turbidity.
- Alarms are generated for abnormal conditions (low/high level, high turbidity, low pressure, etc.).
- All critical parameters are monitored and logged.
- Local HMI/SCADA for operator interface; remote monitoring optional.
- **Architecture Update:** The system now uses a modular process and control architecture, with clear separation of sensors, logic, and actuators as shown in the updated flowcharts. PLC/SCADA or software logic group handles all process decisions and actuator commands.

### 2. Main Control Logic
- **Seawater Intake Pump**: Starts if pre-treatment and RO are ready, stops on low ground tank level or alarm.
- **Pre-treatment**: Backwash cycle triggered by high differential pressure or timer.
- **RO High-Pressure Pump**: Starts if pre-treatment is OK and ground tank has sufficient level; stops on low pressure, high pressure, or low ground tank level.
- **Post-treatment**: Disinfection and remineralization run in parallel with RO output.
- **Transfer Pump to Roof Tank**: Starts if roof tank is not full and ground tank has water; stops if roof tank is full or ground tank is low.
- **Alarms**: Any abnormal sensor reading triggers alarm and can stop relevant equipment.
- **Architecture Update:** Logic is now explicitly mapped from sensors to logic functions to actuators, as per the new flowcharts. All sensor values are routed to a central logic group (PLC or software), which then controls actuators.

### 5. Notes
- All analog signals are 4–20 mA.
- All pumps and valves have local/remote and manual/auto modes.
- System can be expanded for remote monitoring, data logging, and advanced diagnostics.
- **Architecture Update:** The I/O table now includes all actuators and sensors as per the new architecture, including additional pumps (P-103 to P-106), system control variables (System_Running, Emergency_Stop), and explicit mapping between PLC variables and HMI display elements.
- **Synchronization**: I/O table fully matches current PLC implementation (plc file) and HMI display (hmi.py) as of latest update.
