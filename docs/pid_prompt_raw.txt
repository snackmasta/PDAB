Generate a detailed P&ID for a modular desalination and rooftop storage system following ISA/ANSI standards. The system includes the following main process sections: seawater intake, pre-treatment filtration, reverse osmosis (RO) desalination, post-treatment (mineralization and UV disinfection), ground storage tank, pump room, rooftop storage tank, and distribution to building. Show all process flow paths for water and brine, including intake, filtration, RO, post-treatment, storage, transfer, and waste discharge. Include all instrumentation: level transmitters for ground and roof tanks (LT-101, LT-102), flow transmitters for intake and RO permeate (FT-101, FT-102), pressure transmitters for RO feed and permeate (PT-101, PT-102), turbidity sensor (TU-101). Show all actuators: seawater intake pump (P-101), RO high-pressure pump (P-102), post-treatment pump (P-103), transfer pumps (P-104 to P-106), motorized valves (V-101 to V-106), UV disinfection unit (UV-101), general alarm (ALM-101), pressure relief valve (PRV-101). Show the PLC or control logic group with all I/O connections to sensors and actuators. Indicate all control loops: flow control, pressure control, level control, and quality control. Use ISA/ANSI standard symbols for all instruments and actuators, with solid lines for process flow, dashed lines for instrument signals, and double lines for control networks. Tag all devices according to the I/O table. Layout should flow left to right from intake to distribution, with clear separation between process sections. Include safety systems such as emergency stop, pressure relief, overflow protection, and alarms. Add operating ranges for all sensors and actuators, and note all critical setpoints and alarm thresholds. Ensure the diagram shows the complete relationship between all process variables, control elements, and safety systems, and is suitable for engineering review and plant documentation.
