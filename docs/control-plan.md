# Control System Plan and I/O Table

## 1. Control Philosophy
- The system is fully automated with manual override for all pumps and valves.
- Main control logic is based on water levels, flow, pressure, and turbidity.
- Alarms are generated for abnormal conditions (low/high level, high turbidity, low pressure, etc.).
- All critical parameters are monitored and logged.
- Local HMI/SCADA for operator interface; remote monitoring optional.
- **Architecture Update:** The system now uses a modular process and control architecture, with clear separation of sensors, logic, and actuators as shown in the updated flowcharts. PLC/SCADA or software logic group handles all process decisions and actuator commands.

## 2. Main Control Logic
- **Seawater Intake Pump**: Starts if pre-treatment and RO are ready, stops on low ground tank level or alarm.
- **Pre-treatment**: Backwash cycle triggered by high differential pressure or timer.
- **RO High-Pressure Pump**: Starts if pre-treatment is OK and ground tank has sufficient level; stops on low pressure, high pressure, or low ground tank level.
- **Post-treatment**: Disinfection and remineralization run in parallel with RO output.
- **Transfer Pump to Roof Tank**: Starts if roof tank is not full and ground tank has water; stops if roof tank is full or ground tank is low.
- **Alarms**: Any abnormal sensor reading triggers alarm and can stop relevant equipment.
- **Architecture Update:** Logic is now explicitly mapped from sensors to logic functions to actuators, as per the new flowcharts. All sensor values are routed to a central logic group (PLC or software), which then controls actuators.

## 4. Notes
- All analog signals are 4â€“20 mA.
- All pumps and valves have local/remote and manual/auto modes.
- System can be expanded for remote monitoring, data logging, and advanced diagnostics.
- **Architecture Update:** The I/O table now includes all actuators and sensors as per the new architecture, including additional pumps (P-103 to P-106) and explicit mapping to logic/PLC functions.
